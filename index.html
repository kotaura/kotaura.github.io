      <div class="w-full md:w-3/4 leading-normal column-0 lg:column-2">I am Kota Ura.<br>I graduated <a href="https://www.ucsc-extension.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, Santa Cruz Extension</a> with a technology & engineering - database & data analytics certificate in 2015. I also graduated Kanagawa University with an economics - modern business degree in 2010.<br>I am currently working at a company called <a href="https://www.gaussy.com/" target="_blank">Gaussy</a>, a carved-out company from <a href="https://www.mitsubishicorp.com/jp/en/" target="_blank">Mitsubishi Corporation</a>, as a product manager. Previously I have worked at Omise Payment, <a href="https://www.isid.co.jp/" target="_blank">Information Services International Dentsu</a>, <a href="https://wise.com/" target="_blank">Wise (formerly known as TransferWise)</a>, <a href="https://purse.io/" target="_blank">Purse.io</a> and <a href="https://www.iact.co.jp/" target="_blank">IACT Corporation</a>.<br>Several projects I have been working on; <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/" target="_blank">Day One</a> app - Japanese translation in 2018, <a href="https://github.com/OpenEmu/OpenEmu" target="_blank">OpenEmu</a> translation on Github from 2016 to 2018. Bitcoin statistical analytics chart app called BTC Stats, and FlyPal app for <a href="http://emirateshackathon.com/recap_sfo_2015" target="_blank">Emirates Travel Hackathon</a>, last two were held in 2015 when I lived in San Francisco, California. I wish I could go back. I moved to the United States in 2014.<br>I speak Japanese as a native speaker, and professional proficiency in English.<br>I spoke at Japan-America society of St. Louis in 2018 about <a href="http://www.us-japan.org/programs/spf/2018/jasstl_program.pdf" target="_blank">Entrepreneurship and Business incubation in Japan and the United States</a> (<a href="https://github.com/kotaura/kotaura.github.io/raw/master/assets/jasstl_program.pdf" target="_blank">Backup</a>). I love the States, even though they have very short history compare with other countries. I feel freedom when I see the salsa-bar at El Pollo Loco. I support equality for all humans and stand against racism.<br>I have some certificates, for instance <a href="https://www.licensedscrum.com/credential-lookup/?&first_name=Kota&last_name=Ura&country=Japan" target="_blank">Licensed Scrum Master</a>, Database & Data Analytics certificate at UCSC, and Google Analytics qualifier.<br>My happiness is made by being honest to myself seeking what I really want. On the other hand, I always care about the customer. My voice is never louder than the customer. Satisfaction is nowhere near enough.<br>My favorite saying is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QH5hBOoz08&t=95s" target="_blank">"Giving up is not in the blood, sir. Not in the blood."</a>. I was so encouraged by this. Probably, nothing is impossible, as long as you are pursuing your dream.<br>Born and raised in Tokyo, Japan. I love traveling, hiking, power-lifting, snacks and candies. A goal of mine in life is to live and work on all six continents. I am three down with three to go. Ping me if you could take me to Antarctica, but I usually don't reply back to a random message, especially if you are working at recruiting agency.
